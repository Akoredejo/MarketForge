üöÄ Introduction
---------------

**MarketForge** is a core component for building decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and financial applications on the Stacks blockchain. It addresses the fundamental challenge of price discovery in a transparent and automated manner. By implementing a traditional order book model combined with a dynamic automated market making (AMM) function, the contract ensures deep liquidity and accurate, real-time pricing without relying on centralized oracles.

This contract enables users to:

-   Place limit orders to buy or sell assets.

-   Execute trades directly from the order book.

-   Provide liquidity as a market maker with dynamic spreads.

-   Track real-time market data, including price and volume.

* * * * *

‚ú® Features
----------

-   **Order Book Management**: A classic, on-chain order book that stores active buy and sell orders, enabling efficient and transparent trade matching.

-   **Dynamic Price Discovery**: The contract's `current-prices` map is updated with every executed trade, providing a real-time price feed for each token pair.

-   **Automated Market Making (AMM)**: The `provide-market-liquidity` function allows users to automatically create a series of buy and sell orders with a specified spread, acting as a dynamic liquidity provider.

-   **Risk Management**: The AMM function includes built-in volatility adjustments and exposure checks to help protect liquidity providers.

-   **Error Handling**: A comprehensive set of error codes ensures that all invalid or unauthorized actions are handled gracefully and securely.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
-------------------

To deploy and interact with the **MarketForge** contract, you will need the Stacks CLI or a compatible development environment such as the Clarinet suite.

### Prerequisites

-   [Stacks CLI](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-cli)

-   [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet)

### Deployment

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/marketforge.git`

2.  Navigate to the contract directory.

3.  Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain using the Stacks CLI.

### Interaction

You can interact with the contract's public functions using the Stacks CLI or a front-end application.

**Example: Placing an Order**

```
$ stacks-cli contract call ST000000000000000000002S661M.market-forge place-order '("STX-USDC" "buy" u1000000 u5000000)'

```

This command places a buy order for 1 STX at a price of 5 USDC.

üèóÔ∏è Contract Architecture
-------------------------

The contract is structured to be modular and secure, with a clear separation of concerns.

üîì Public Functions
-------------------

### `place-order`

`(define-public (place-order (token-pair (string-ascii 20)) (order-type (string-ascii 4)) (quantity uint) (price uint)))`

-   **Purpose**: Places a new limit order in the order book.

-   **Parameters**:

    -   `token-pair`: The trading pair (e.g., "STX-USDC").

    -   `order-type`: The type of order ("buy" or "sell").

    -   `quantity`: The amount of the asset to trade.

    -   `price`: The desired price for the trade.

-   **Returns**: `(ok order-id)` on success, or an error code on failure.

### `execute-trade`

`(define-public (execute-trade (buy-order-id uint) (sell-order-id uint)))`

-   **Purpose**: Executes a trade between a buyer and a seller.

-   **Parameters**:

    -   `buy-order-id`: The unique ID of the buy order.

    -   `sell-order-id`: The unique ID of the sell order.

-   **Returns**: `(ok trade-quantity)` on success, or an error code on failure.

### `cancel-order`

`(define-public (cancel-order (order-id uint)))`

-   **Purpose**: Allows a trader to cancel their own active order.

-   **Parameters**:

    -   `order-id`: The unique ID of the order to cancel.

-   **Returns**: `(ok true)` on success, or an error code on failure.

### `provide-market-liquidity`

`(define-public (provide-market-liquidity (token-pair (string-ascii 20)) (base-quantity uint) (spread-percentage uint) (max-exposure uint)))`

-   **Purpose**: Creates a series of buy and sell orders to provide dynamic liquidity.

-   **Parameters**:

    -   `token-pair`: The trading pair.

    -   `base-quantity`: The total quantity of tokens to be split across the order levels.

    -   `spread-percentage`: The desired spread around the market price.

    -   `max-exposure`: The maximum allowed exposure for the market maker.

-   **Returns**: `(ok { ... })` with a summary of the created orders on success, or an error code on failure.

* * * * *

üîí Private Functions
--------------------

-   `calculate-weighted-price`: A private function to calculate a price based on order book depth, with a specific adjustment for large orders.

-   `min-uint`: A simple helper function to determine the minimum of two unsigned integers.

-   `validate-order`: Ensures that all order parameters meet the minimum requirements before being processed.

-   `update-market-depth`: An internal function that updates the `market-depth` map after an order is placed or executed, which is crucial for real-time market analysis.

* * * * *

üîç Read-Only Functions
----------------------

### `get-current-price`

`(define-read-only (get-current-price (token-pair (string-ascii 20))))`

-   **Parameters**:

    -   `token-pair`: The trading pair.

-   **Returns**: `(some { ... })` with the current price data, or `(none)` if no data exists.

* * * * *

üö® Error Codes
--------------

-   `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED` (`u100`): The transaction sender is not authorized to perform the action.
